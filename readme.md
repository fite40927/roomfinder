# To run
Open your terminal, navigate to folder and execute py file.
```
    $ python roomfinder.py
```
A list of available and occupied rooms available during a time frame will be printed to the terminal.

## Bugs and plans
1. As of now, clubs and non-course related bookings are not accounted for. 
2. If a room is occupied for any duration during the range, then it is listed as occupied by the script. 

## Future development plans
1. Also output classrooms that are available for at least an hour during the specified time range.
